# FFMP
Connecting Fabric's Mixin to Forge

---

I'm still testing it.

**Working versions:** 1.21.1-1.21.8

**Untested:** Other versions

## How to use?
FFMP is not a Mod! Nor is it a Javaagent, but an independent Patcher application!

Download FFMP, place it in your client or server's root directory, and then run the command to run FFMP.

Before running the patch, please back up your dependencies, launcher file (xxxx.json),
and the Forge shim launcher, and close all running games and servers.

If you are running in the client, you will also need to restart your launcher after the patch is complete.
